# CoffeeShoppee

/

### ** Project Plan Outline**

#### **1. Project Overview**

**Objective:**

- **Title:** Coffee Shoppee
- **Description:** Develop a responsive website that showcases coffee recipes from various countries. An interactive 3D rotating globe will serve as the main interface, allowing users to explore recipes by clicking on coffee bean icons placed over different countries.;

**Key Features:**

- **Interactive 3D Rotating Globe:** Clickable coffee bean icons over countries to display recipes.;
- **Recipe Pages:** Detailed recipes with ingredients, preparation steps, cultural background, and YouTube video links, including images or videos.;
- **Responsive Design:** Ensure accessibility and visual appeal on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.;
- **Search and Filter Functionality:** Users can search for recipes by name, ingredient, or country and filter based on brewing method or flavor profile.;

#### **2. Collaboration Strategy**

- **Roles and Responsibilities:** 
  - **Both:** Work on both front-end and back-end to gain full-stack experience.;
- **Version Control:** 
  - Use Git and GitHub for code collaboration and version tracking.;
  - Regularly commit changes with clear messages to reflect contributions.;

#### **3. Technical Insight**

**Technologies and Tools:**

- **Front-End:** HTML5, CSS3 (using media queries for responsiveness), JavaScript.;
- **Back-End:** Node.js, Express.js for server-side coding.;
- **Data Handling:** JSON files for storing and accessing coffee recipes.;
- **Interactive Map:** Planetary.js for creating the 3D rotating globe, TopoJSON and GeoJSON for geographical data.;
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub for collaboration and code management.;

**Integration Plan:**

- **Globe Implementation:** Use Planetary.js to create the 3D rotating globe with custom markers.;
- **Event Handling:** Add click events to markers to fetch and display recipes.;
- **Responsive Design:** Utilize media queries in CSS to adjust layouts.;
- **Module Organization:** Organize code into modules for clarity (separate files for globe functionality, recipe data handling, UI components).;

**YouTube Integration:**

- **Recipe Pages:** Include an iframe to embed YouTube videos or link directly to YouTube videos relevant to the recipes.;

#### **4. Visual Aids (Optional but Recommended)**

**Wireframes and Mockups:**

- **Home Page:** Layout featuring the interactive globe prominently, including a navigation menu.;
- **Recipe Page:** Template showing recipe details (image, name, ingredients list, preparation steps, cultural notes, and YouTube video links).;
- **Mobile Views:** Mockups for mobile devices to ensure responsive design.;

**User Flow Diagrams:**

- Show user navigation from home page to recipe viewing:
  1. User lands on home page with interactive globe.;
  2. User clicks on a coffee bean icon over a country.;
  3. A modal or new page displays recipes from that country, including YouTube video links.;
  4. User selects a specific recipe to view details.;

#### **5. Soliciting Mentor Feedback**

- **Alignment Check:** Share the refined project plan with a mentor to ensure it meets project requirements.;
- **Feedback Implementation:** Adjust the plan based on mentor feedback.;

#### **6. Additional Considerations**

**Project Timeline:**

- **February 1 - February 10:** Finalize project plan and designs, set up GitHub repository and project structure.;
- **February 11 - February 28:** Begin development:;
  - **Both:** Work on front-end and back-end setup simultaneously.;
- **March 1 - March 15:** Integrate front-end and back-end components, implement interactive globe and connect it to recipe data.;
- **March 16 - March 25:** Testing and debugging, optimize for responsiveness and performance.;
- **March 26 - March 28:** Final revisions and preparation for submission.;

**Collaboration Tools:**

- **Communication:** Platforms like Slack, Text messages, or Google Classroom.;


**Accessibility and Standards:**

- **SEO Optimization:** Naturally include relevant keywords in your content, headings, and meta descriptions.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure site is navigable via keyboard, include alt text for images, use appropriate color contrasts.
