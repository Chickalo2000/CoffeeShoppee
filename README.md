# CoffeeShoppee

CoffeeShoppee is a dynamic, full-stack project that seamlessly blends technology and creativity to bring coffee enthusiasts a unique global experience. The centerpiece of the website is a visually engaging 3D rotating globe, built using Planetary.js, which allows users to explore and discover coffee recipes from different countries by interacting with clickable coffee bean markers. Each recipe provides a comprehensive view of the coffee culture it represents, including ingredients, preparation steps, cultural background, and embedded YouTube videos. With an emphasis on accessibility and user engagement, CoffeeShoppee incorporates responsive design, ensuring smooth navigation and aesthetic appeal across all devices. Additionally, a Coffee Fun Fact Generator and a recipe submission form invite users to actively participate, either by enjoying entertaining coffee trivia or by contributing their own recipes to celebrate their culture. Powered by robust backend technology, including Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, this project also demonstrates proficient use of version control with Git and GitHub, modular code organization, and a collaborative approach to development. CoffeeShoppee is designed not just to inform and delight, but to connect coffee lovers around the world through an interactive and user-friendly platform.
